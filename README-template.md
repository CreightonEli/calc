## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
  - Everything adjusts. It is currently a binary choice between screen sizes above and below 1281 pixels wide. Could improve upon this to adjust further but two is good enough for now.
- [x] Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
  - This was more of a headache than I thought it would be but I guess that's what I get for doing this with just JavaScript. I'm taking this as a sign to move towards TypeScript in the future.
- [x] Adjust the color theme based on their preference
  - This was a newer undertaking for me. I was already very familiar with CSS variables but using that in tandem with data attributes makes theme switching a lot simpler.
- [ ] **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
  - Didn't get this sorted out just yet. Maybe someday soon...
